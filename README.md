# test_avencom
1. First run db.py file in order to connect to db(write your data in the file)
2. Then run main.py in will take and clear the data from data.csv
3. In query.txt You can find sql sort function.
4. telegram_sender file have call-back function to /start command and send the document to the user.
## Problem of the code
1. I don't write the parser because you have in test document csv files. But if you want to see the parser
I have the ads parser in my github rep.
2. The clear data don't work correctly. You can see that in db when you sort the data.
3. In sql function don't have report for the auto year with max popular.
